Hey guys! At SHAD News, one of the things that we want to do is include the community. If you would like, you can [send us]({{site.askshad}}) anything that you'd like; it might get featured on one of our segments!

If you have any questions or feedback, you can also send it to us via the [ask SHAD News form]({{site.askshad}}). It'll also be in the navbar for easy access.

Thanks for reading, and have a great SHADittude!
